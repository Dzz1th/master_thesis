 is a near-<br>term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it’s<br>something that’s temporary or more enduring? And how much inflation is the Fed willing to<br>tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?<br>CHAIR POWELL. So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that<br>are worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month<br>basis. And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year,<br>we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just—they’re called base<br>effects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.<br>There’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully<br>reopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the<br>pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.<br>Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In<br>both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react<br>is, we’re going to be patient. Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we<br>would review—we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.<br>I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the<br>United States has had now </div>
