      "In support of our goals, today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of our three previous meetings, we lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market. With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We’re not on any preset course.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains—economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\n",
      "The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have—focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals, and really keeping our heads down and doing our work. And that’s how we best serve the public.\n",
      "Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you and several of your colleagues said around the time of the last meeting that your policy stance was “meaningfully restrictive.” Given economic and financial market developments since then, how has your confidence changed in an assessment that says interest rates are meaningfully restrictive?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. I don’t think that my assessment really has changed. I mean, a couple of things have happened. We’ve gotten more strong data, but we’ve also seen rates move up at the long end, which could represent a tightening in financial conditions. I think if we look back over the past year or so, we can see that policy is restrictive. If you look at the effect of high rates on interest-sensitive spending—for example, in housing—and if you look at the achievement of our goal variables, we’re seeing the economy move toward 2 percent inflation and, and has moved largely to maximum employment, so. Though we literally look at the—at the—at movement toward the goal variables to make that assessment. Now, policy is meaningfully less restrictive than it was before we began to cut. It’s 100 basis points less restrictive. And for that reason, you know, we’re going to be focusing on seeing real progress on inflation or, alternatively, some weakness in the labor market before we—before we consider making adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up. Does the economy here warrant meaningfully restrictive interest rates, and would you judge interest rates to still be meaningfully restrictive if you were to lower them by another ¼ point?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. So, I, I think our policy stance is very well calibrated, as I mentioned, to balance the achievement of our two—of our two goals. We, we want to—policy to be restrictive enough to continue to foster further, further progress for our 2 percent inflation goal. At the same time, we don’t need to see further weakening in the labor market to achieve that goal, and that’s kind of what we’ve been getting. The labor market has really been broadly stable; the unemployment rate has been broadly stable now for six months. Conditions seem to be broadly in balance. And I would say, look at the last couple of inflation readings and you see we don’t—we don’t overreact to two good readings or two bad readings. But, nonetheless, the last couple of readings have suggested, you know, more positive readings. So I, I think we’re—I think policy’s well, well positioned.\n",
      "I think where the Committee is very much in the mode of waiting to see what policies are enacted. We, and we, we don’t know what will happen with, with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy, and with regulatory policy. We’re only just beginning to see—actually, are not really beginning to see much, and I think we need to—we need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a, a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be. So we’re going to be watching carefully and, and, as we always do. This is no different than any other set of policy changes at the beginning of a—of an Administration. We’ll patiently watch and understand and, and, you know, kind of not be in a hurry to, to get to a place of understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out.\n",
      "MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up. The idea that you feel the—that policy is restrictive suggests that the Fed, in general, wants to continue to lower interest rates. So when you look at the data that you are dependent on, are you looking for data that tell you that you can cut or data that will tell you [that] you should hold?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. You know, we’re—we’re looking—it’s more the other—the way—the way it works is, we are looking at the data to guide us in what we should do. And, you know, that, that’s what we do. And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place. Policy’s well positioned. The economy’s in, in quite a good place, actually, as well. And what, what we do expect is to see further progress on inflation, and, you know, as I mentioned, as we see that—or if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position of, of making further adjustments. But, right now, we, we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry to, to make any adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ve said that the Fed is in wait-and-see mode, based on the policies that come out of this Administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s, it’s one thing to do that to make assessments about what might happen and begin to think about what you might do in that case, but you don’t act until you—until you see much more than we see now.\n",
      "CATARINA SARAIVA. You know, last month you talked about a future rate cut as being pretty, you know, significantly predicated on more progress in inflation. With the characterization of the labor market in the statement today, would you say that that’s even more so the case now?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. I’d say it’s the same. You know, we, we want to see, you know, further progress on inflation. And, you know, the story’s there. It’s, it’s—we’re just going to have to see the data. At the end of the day, it, it comes down to 12-month inflation, because that takes out the seasonality issues that may exist. And, you know, we’re, we’re just going to need to see that. We think that—we think we see the pathway for that to happen. One, one example—a key example—is that you now do see owner’s equivalent rent and, you know, housing services—the way it’s calculated for PCE [prices], you see that coming down pretty steadily now, and that’s the—that’s the place where the, most of the remaining gap is. In addition, a big part of the overrun, as you will know, was [coming] from nonmarket services [prices], which don’t tend to send much signal [about future inflation]. So you can look through all that and, and think, “Okay, that then we seem to be set up for further progress.” But being seem to set up for it is one thing; having it is another. So we, we’re going to want to see further, further progress on inflation. Remember, we’re not, you know, we’re, we’re under—2 percent, but our goal is 2 percent, and we do mean to get back sustainably to 2 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANDREW ACKERMAN. The other thing I wanted to ask was just how far away you think you are from neutral.\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, you can’t know with any precision, of course. As I like to say, that you know that—you know the neutral rate by its works. So I think, you know, at 4.3 percent we’re, we’re above pretty much everyone on the Committee’s estimates of the longer-run neutral. I think our eyes are telling us that our policy is having the effects on the economy. That’s really the question we ask. You know, you can consult models, empirical models, theoretical models. You really have to just look out the window and see how your—how your policy rate is affecting the economy. And I think we see that it’s having meaningful effects in bringing inflation under control. It has helped bring the labor market into balance as well. So that’s what we think. I, I would say we’re meaningfully above it. I, I am—I, I have no illusion that, that anyone knows precisely how much that is. And, but it, you know—not knowing that, and having cut 100 basis points, means that it’s appropriate that we—that we not be in a hurry to make further adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIRE JONES. To—what sort of information would you need to see on tariffs? Would you need to see a strategy, actual implementation, actual movement of inflation expectations, before you’re actually willing to change the path of monetary policy on the basis of it?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. ...So we’re just going to have to wait and see. And, you know, the best we can do is what we’ve done, which is study up on this and, you know, look at historical experience, read the literature, and think about the factors that might matter, and then we’ll just have to see—have to see how it—how it goes.\n",
      "I don’t have anything to say to you about particular dates; it’s just that’s the process, and what we see is, is that, that rates do appear to be abundant. As always, we stand ready to take appropriate action to support the smooth transition of monetary policy, including to adjust the details of our approach for reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, as we’ve reduced our, our policy rate 100 basis points, longer rates have gone up. Not because of expectations—not principally because of expectations about our policy or about inflation; it’s more a term premium story. So, and, you know, it’s long rates that matter for, for housing. So I, I don’t think—I think these higher rates are going to—they’re, they’re probably hold back housing activities to some extent, if they’re persistent. We’ll have to see how long they persist. So, you know, we, we are—we control an overnight rate. Generally, it, it propagates through the whole family of asset prices, including interest rates. But in this particular case, it’s all happened at a time when, for reasons unrelated to our policy, longer rates have moved up.\n",
      "Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. You said you want to see further progress on inflation. Given that households appear to be unhappy with the elevated level of prices, do you believe the Committee should wait until inflation has fallen back to target to cut rates again?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn’t say that. We, we’ve never said we need to be all the way at target to reduce rates. At, at any time, what we’re doing is we’re looking at the economy and asking whether our policy stance is the right one to achieve maximum employment and price stability. So I, I think if—we would want to see further progress, but we think our—we think our—as I mentioned, we think that our policy stance is restrictive. Meaningfully restrictive. Not highly restrictive, but meaningfully restrictive. And so I would think we need to see further progress. I wouldn’t say all the way back down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis, although we’d love to see that, of course, and we will.\n",
      "\"You’ve got to look at rates, too, and that, you know, that represents a, a tightening in conditions, with higher rates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EVAN RYSER with Market News International. Chair Powell, is a March cut still on the table? And then, additionally, are you looking to see better-than-expected data on inflation to cut, or are you looking for inflation data that roughly aligns with current forecasts?\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. So, as, as I mentioned, the economy’s strong, the labor market’s solid, downside risks to the labor market appear to have abated, and we think disinflation continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path. That tells me and the other members of the Committee—the broad sense of the Committee, actually, is that we don’t need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re going to want to see, you know, continued progress with housing services inflation; you’re going to want to see inflation behaving in a way that builds confidence that we are really making progress. That’s what it’s going to be.\n",
      "So what we really said was that we wouldn’t—we wouldn’t look at a—at a strong labor market and raise rates unless we saw some evidence of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our framework permitted us to act quite vigorously, and we did once we decided that that’s what we should do. Our framework had really nothing to do with the decision to—we, we looked at the inflation as, as transitory, and—right up to the point where the data turned against that, and when the data turned against that in late ’21, we changed our, our view, and we raised rates a lot.\n",

      "The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.\n",
      "Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  \n",
      "With inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  \n",
      "The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.\n",
      "Inflation is elevated/uncomfortably high.\n",
      "It's very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent and averaging 2 percent over time.\n",
      "So, on inflation, a couple of things—there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis. And as we—as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just—they’re called base effects, and, and that’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.  \n",
      "There’s also the possibility—indeed, it’s in some forecasts—that as the economy fully reopens, there’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation. Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In both cases, we don’t see those as either lasting or particularly large.  \n",
      "I think if you—you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century.\n",
      "So we think it’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation.  \n",
      "Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that.  \n",
      "In terms of how much, you know, what we’ve said is we’d like to see—because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time.  \n",
      "And, again, we’ll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\n",
      "We adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August.\n",
      "Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in the both domestic and global context that we’ve been in for some time.\n",

      "Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, and demand for workers remains very strong.  \n",

      "The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September. This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued.  \n",
      "Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements. But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels—in part reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.  \n",
      "As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings.  \n",
      "These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus—supporting gains in employment and economic activity.  \n",
      "The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics.\n",
      "We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price-stability goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up.\n",
      "We measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t see troubling increases in wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inflation that we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market.\n",
      "We don’t think it’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further.\n",
      "Really, that’s one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment.  \n",
      "You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that?  \n",
      "Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring, and there’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of that and other trends.  \n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So maximum employment is, it’s a broad—what would we say?—broad-based and inclusive goal that’s not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors.  \n",
      "So it’s taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment—levels of employment—[and] participation are a part of that.  \n",
      "But, in addition, there are other measures of what’s going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is—the level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states.  \n",
      "Ideally, we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn’t another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot.  \n",
      "Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and] because of fear of COVID to a significant extent.  \n",
      "You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply. That doesn’t seem to have been the case, interestingly.  \n",
      "So I think there’s room for a whole lot of humility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be.  \n",
      "So it’s a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year.\n",
      "we’re not at maximum employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "it’s clearly not met on the maximum-employment side.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight labor market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "there are, you know—with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we’re set up to go back to a higher job-creation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that would suggest that you’re not at maximum employment.\n",
      "We need to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further.  \n",
      "Delta stopped job creation.\n",
      "And the reason is that there’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment.  \n",
      "That’s when we’re really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.  \n",
      "But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment.  \n",
      "This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people.  \n",
      "I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, thank you. Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment. We’ve seen what’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers. Is there any feeling there that maybe you’ve been accused of “fighting the last war” — that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before?\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, what’s happening is, people are leaving their jobs. They’re quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers—but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages. So a lot of the higher wages you’re seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents. So that’s just, that’s a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting. There have also been—there are a significant number of retirements, and we’ll just have to see what that means.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire. So maybe this was just catch-up on that. I am a believer that, over time, you won’t know how far—you won’t know what can happen with labor force participation in advance. You’re just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we expect labor force participation to pick up. We don’t know the pace at which it will do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. There was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor market.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you ask about full employment. I think we have to—I’m very open to the thought that it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we’re just going to learn more and more. I mean, one thing we’ll learn, I think, I hope we’ll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what’s going to happen to employment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again?\n",
